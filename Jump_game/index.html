	<h1>Jump Game</h1>
	<p id="infoText">This program finds a solution for randomly generated boards. The game is played by starting at the first square, and jumping up to the number spaces shown on the square. For example, if the first square has a 3, you can jump 1, 2, or 3 spaces. Repeat this process until you reach the last square. Numbers range from 0 to 3.</p>
